# Post-Surgery-Recovery-Tracker
“A website that helps both patients and doctors digitalize patient records."
# 🏥 Post-Surgery Recovery Tracker

An AI-powered healthcare application that helps patients and doctors monitor post-surgery recovery remotely. The system allows patients to log their daily health status while enabling doctors to monitor recovery progress through dashboards, risk prediction models, and wound image analysis.

---

## 📖 Overview

Post-surgical patients often recover at home with limited medical supervision. Delayed identification of complications such as infections, abnormal pain, or poor wound healing can lead to serious health risks.

The **Post-Surgery Recovery Tracker** provides a centralized platform where:

- Patients record daily recovery information.
- Doctors monitor patient progress remotely.
- AI models estimate recovery and risk levels.
- Computer vision analyzes wound images for possible infection.
- Appointment scheduling and medication reminders improve follow-up care.

### Recovery Prediction

Machine Learning model predicts patient recovery based on:

- Pain Score
- Mobility
- Sleep Quality
- Medication Adherence
- Wound Condition

- Infection Probability

---

### Risk Assessment

The ML model estimates:

- Low Risk
- Medium Risk
- High Risk

based on patient health logs.
